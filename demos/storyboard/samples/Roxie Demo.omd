# Roxie Demo

_A [@hpcc-js/observable-md](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/Visualization/tree/trunk/packages/observable-md) demo - these demos are currently a work in progress and have dependencies which may or may not exist at any given time..._

## Calling a Roxie Service
_For this example we will be calling the following Roxie Service_

* **baseUrl:**  "${baseUrl}"
* **querySet:**  "${querySet}"
* **querID:**  "${queryID}"

```
//  Initialize Target
baseUrl = "https://play.hpccsystems.com:18002";
querySet = "roxie";
queryID = "covid19_by_us_states";

//  Initialize Roxie
r = roxie("https://play.hpccsystems.com:18002");
q = r.query("roxie", "covid19_by_countries");
requestFields = q.requestFields();
responseFields = q.responseFields();
```

Once connected to the server we can query the service for its request/response schemas:

* Request Schema: 
```json
${JSON.stringify(requestFields, undefined, "    ")}
```

* Response Schema:
```json
${JSON.stringify(responseFields, undefined, "    ")}
```

At which point we can make some actual REST requests:

```javascript
q.submit({
    countriesfilter: "FRANCE"
});
```

```
response = q.submit({
    countriesfilter: "FRANCE"
});
```

Actual Response:
```json
${JSON.stringify(response, undefined, "    ")} 
```
